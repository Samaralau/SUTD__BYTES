# SUTD__BYTES

SUTD Bytes is a community-driven food delivery app designed specifically for students at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). The app enables students to either request food deliveries or volunteer to deliver food to peers on campus. It's a peer-to-peer platform that promotes convenience, collaboration, and rewards.

Features:

1. Request Food

   Students can request meals from food stalls of nearby shopping malls and have them delivered by fellow students.

2. Volunteer to Deliver

    Help your peers by delivering their food orders. Flexible and rewarding.

3. Earn Points for Deliveries

   Delivery volunteers accumulate points for each successful delivery depending on the distance travelled which can be later redeemed for discounts.


Note:
